# Docker QoL
A collection of tools to make your Docker experience a bit less cumbersome.

This collection will be expanded as I come up with ideas or people make recommendations/commits. I will also aim to create a Python version
of each script to preserve system cross-compatibility.

# Toolbox
| Tool name | Description |
| :-------: | :---------: |
| dbash     | Enter any the shell of any container that has bash installed using only part of its name |

# To-do
- Create Python version of dbash
